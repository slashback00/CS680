This Java application demonstrates the Strategy design pattern by simulating different animal patterns and their purposes. The Animal class uses the AnimalPattern interface to display the pattern and its purpose for different animals, such as zebras, leopards, and peacocks.
This will compile the Java classes and run the TestAnimalPatterns class, which demonstrates the use of the Strategy design pattern in this application.
The AnimalPattern interface defines the displayPattern() method, which is implemented by the Stripes, Spots, and ColorfulFeathers classes. These classes represent different animal patterns and their purposes. The Animal class takes an instance of an AnimalPattern object in its constructor and uses it to display the pattern and its purpose.
The TestAnimalPatterns class creates instances of different animals with different patterns and calls their displayPattern() method to demonstrate the use of the Strategy design pattern.
